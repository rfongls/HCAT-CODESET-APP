# Codeset UI Executable

This folder is intended to hold a standalone executable of the Codeset UI app
built with [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/). After generating the
executable using `python build_executable.py` on a machine with PyInstaller
installed, place the resulting `codeset_app.exe` file in this directory for
distribution.

> **Note:** Building the executable requires PyInstaller. In this environment the
package could not be installed, so the compiled executable is not included.
